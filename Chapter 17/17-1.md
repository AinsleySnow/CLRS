Suppose we perform $n$ operations of pop, push, multipush and multipop. Thus we can perform at most $k_n$ pushes. So the upper bound of operations is $O(k_n)$. Therefore the time per operation takes turns out to be $O(k)$.

First we describe the decrement procedure:  
```
DECREMENT(A)
i = 0
while i < A.length and A[i] == 0
    A[i] = 1
    i = i + 1
if i < A.length
    A[i] = 0
```
For a given sequence of $n$ operations including decrement and increment, if we flip $k$ bits using increment and then flip them back, the running time will be $nk$.  

# 17.1-3
Let $T(n)$ be the cost of total $n$ operations. We have:   
$$
T(n) < n + \sum_{i = 1}^{\lfloor \lg n \rfloor + 1}2^i = n + 2^{\lfloor \lg n \rfloor + 2} - 2 \le 4n - 2 + n \in O(n)
$$
So the amortized cost per operation is a constant.
