We charge 2 dollars for each operation. The operation itself costs immediately one dollar; Backuping cost one dollar. Since the stack's size never exceeds $k$, and we always back the stack up every $k$ operations, so there's always enough dollars to pay these operations. So the cost of $n$ stack operations is $O(n)$.

Note that numbers that are exactly power of 2 is $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 \cdots$. We charge 3 dollars for each operation. So the costs of $i$ operations is 
$$
\begin{align*}
&i - (\lfloor \lg i \rfloor) + \sum_{n = 0}^{\lfloor \lg i \rfloor} 2^n \\
=& \; i - \lfloor \lg i \rfloor - 2 + 2^{\lfloor \lg i \rfloor + 1} \\
\le& \; 3i - \lfloor \lg i \rfloor - 2
\end{align*}
$$
Since we have charged 3 dollars for each operation, there are always enough dollars to pay for it. So the cost of the operations is $O(n)$.

As the hint reads, keep a pointer to the high-order 1. We charge 2 dollars for setting a bit to 1 as usual, and 1 dollar for checking whether a bit is resetted. So there's always enough dollars for paying these operations. The pointer to the high-order 1 guarantees that resetting doesn't consume the dollar reserved for the INCREMENT procedure.
