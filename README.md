主要是《算法导论》中示例算法和题目的C语言实现。  
也有一些代码是用 C++ 或者 C# 写的，因为每次做题都要先用C语言实现基础数据结构，真的太痛苦了。  
STL 它不香么？  
这个仓库的 commit 记录可以不用看了——实在是太乱了。
另外……这边的大部分代码还没来得及调试……所以谨慎参考里面的代码……

Implementation of sample algorithms and exercise of CLRS using C language.  
As you'll see, some code is written in C++ or C#, cuz it's REALLY painful to type code of basic data structure everytime before you actually do the exercise...
STL is so lovely, isn't it?  
Plz don't bother looking the repository's commit history. It's just too messy.
And most of these code hasn't been debuged yet. So please use the code inside carefully...
